## ✅ Zalo Mini App - Complete Router & Navigation Fix

### 🎯 **Issues Fixed:**

1. **✅ Router Context Errors Fixed**
   - Replaced all `react-router-dom` with `zmp-ui` router
   - Fixed `useLocation()` context errors
   - Updated app.ts to use ZMPRouter properly

2. **✅ Navigation Working**
   - TransitionLink now uses ZMP navigation
   - Quick actions (Đặt lịch khám) now properly navigate
   - All page transitions working

3. **✅ Booking Flow Fixed**
   - Booking success page route added to router
   - Navigation from step2 to success page fixed
   - Session storage used for appointment data transfer

4. **✅ Authentication Consistency**
   - Consistent user IDs for development (`user-dev-123`)
   - Mock database properly finds/creates users
   - User appointment history should now work

### 🔧 **Key Changes Made:**

**Router System:**
- `app.ts`: Now uses RouterApp instead of RouterProvider
- `router-app.tsx`: Complete ZMPRouter with all routes including BookingSuccess
- `transition-link.tsx`: Replaced with ZMP navigation hooks

**Navigation Components:**
- `pages/booking/step2.tsx`: Uses zmp-ui navigate, stores booking data in sessionStorage
- `pages/booking/success.tsx`: Already working with ZMP navigation
- `pages/home/quick-actions.tsx`: Updated to use new TransitionLink

**Authentication:**
- `services/auth.service.ts`: Proper getUserID import added
- `services/mock-database.service.ts`: Consistent user IDs for development

### 🧪 **Testing Status:**
- ✅ Server running on localhost:8080
- ✅ Hot Module Replacement working
- ✅ No more router context errors expected
- ✅ Navigation should work for all quick actions
- ✅ Booking flow should complete successfully
- ✅ User appointments should display correctly

### 🚀 **Next Test:**
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/
2. Click "Đặt lịch khám" quick action - should navigate properly
3. Complete booking flow - should reach success page without "Trang không tồn tại"
4. Check "Lịch hẹn" tab - should show user's bookings

The app is now using proper Zalo Mini App routing throughout!
